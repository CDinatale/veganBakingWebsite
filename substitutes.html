        <h2 class="title">Egg &amp; Dairy Substitutes</h2>
        <p>Baking rich and tasty desserts without animal products might seem like an impossible feat to some.
           In fact most baking enthusiasts will be able to tell you at least one story of how they tried to make
           a vegan dessert once and it turned out tasting like cardboard.  While replacing eggs, milk and butter
           can sometimes be a challenge depending on the recipe, most experienced vegan bakers will tell you that
            omitting these ingredients is actually a lot easier than you think! </p>
        <p>Take it from my italian mother, who is as traditional a cook as it gets! With the help of the following tips
            she was able to put together this lovely vegan tea party for Mother's Day filled with scrumptious vegan
            desserts!</p>

         <h2>Egg-cellent vegan Substitutions for Eggs</h2>
         <h3>The Role of Eggs</h3>
         <p>Eggs are made up of water as well as protein and fat. Recipes for baked goods
             usually use eggs for 3 reasons:</p>
         <ol>
             <li><span class="highlight">They provide structure:</span>  Eggs harden when heated which works to bind
                 ingredients together and to strengthen the finished product.</li>
             <li><span class="highlight">They provide moisture and richness:</span> Because of the fat content in egg
                 yolks, they add moisture and richness to the flavor of baked goods. </li>
             <li><span class="highlight">They help with the leavening:</span> As the water evaporates off of the eggs
                 it helps to lighten and leaven baked goods.</li>
         </ol>
    </section>
     <section>
         <p> Now that we understand how eggs work in a recipe, let's talk about how to substitute them!</p>
         <h3>Flax Eggs</h3>
         <iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouUW810R5to"
                 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         <p> A flax seed egg, or a flegg, is an egg substitute made from flax seed and water. A shown in the video, to make
             a flax egg, you simply mix one tablespoon of flax meal with three tablespoons of hot water and let it sit for
             about 5 minutes. When mixed with water, flax meal turns into a gel called hydrocolloid, which can emulate the
             binding nature of a regular egg in various recipes.</p>
         <p><span class="red"> When to use flax eggs:</span>It is best to use flax eggs in heartier recipes, like in
             brownies, cookies, muffins, banana breads, carrot cake etc.</p>
         <p>Flax Eggs worked great in my Banana Strawberry breakfast muffins!</p>
         <img class="border" src="img/veganmuffins.jpg" alt="strawberry banana muffins" height="404" width="323"/>
         <h3>Chia Seed Eggs</h3>
         <img class="border" src="img/chiaegg.jpg" alt="chia seed mixture" height="281" width="420"/>
         <p>A chia egg is simply made from water and whole chia seeds. Chia seeds work in the exact same way as flax meal
             does to bind ingredients together. To make a chia egg just mix one tablespoon of chia seeds with 3
             tablespoons of hot water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Chia seeds are also great vegan source of Omega 3
             and protein! </p>
         <p><span class="red">When to use chia eggs:</span> Like flax eggs, you can use chia eggs in heartier recipes,
             like in brownies, cookies, muffins, banana breads, carrot cake etc.</p>
         <h3>Egg Replacer Powder</h3>
         <p>All egg replacer powders are made up of a combination of starches flours and rising agents, so they
             do a great job of mimicking eggs in dessert recipes. They are especially useful when volume in a recipe is
             important and can be found in most grocery stores.</p>
         <p><span class="red"> When to use egg replacer powders:</span>Egg Replacer powders are very versatile and can
             be use in all baking recipes that call for eggs. They even work well when making light and fluffy cakes
             and pancakes! </p>
         <h3>Silken Tofu</h3>
         <p>If a recipe is only using eggs to add moisture, then replacing them with pureed silken tofu works well. Just
             substitute ¼ cup silken tofu for 1 egg.  A bonus is that tofu is also packed with protein! </p>
         <p><span class="red">When to use tofu:</span> Tofu works well in dense recipes like in brownies, cheesecakes,
             ice cream, or puddings. </p>
         <h3>Baking soda and Vinegar</h3>
         <p> The chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar helps baked goods rise and
             makes cakes, cupcakes, or muffins light,fluffy and airy. Mix 1 tsp of baking soda with 1 tsp of white
             vinegar to replace 1 egg. </p>
         <p><span class="red"> When to use baking soda and vinegar:</span> This combination works best when you want
             your desserts to be light and fluffy, like in cakes and cupcakes.</p>
         <h3>Mashed Banana or Applesauce</h3>
         <p>Like tofu, mashed banana and applesauce work to add moisture to a recipe. They both work well as long as there
            is another leaving agent present in the recipe. Use ¼ cup applesauce or mashed banana for 1 egg. This is a
             very healthy alternative to eggs and works in recipes where you won't mind the extra apple or banana flavour!</p>
         <p><span class="red">When to use banana and applesauce:</span> Banana and applesauce are especially good in
             cookies, cakes and muffins.</p>
         <h3>Aquafaba</h3>
         <iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kExpx2BzIOQ"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         <p>Aquafaba means bean water and in the context of vegan baking, it refers to the liquid in a can of chickpeas.
            Aquafaba is an amazing substitute for egg whites since the proteins and starches are structurally very similar.
             Substitute 1 tablespoon of aquafaba for one egg yolk, two tablespoons of aquafaba for one egg white, or three
             tablespoons of aquafaba for a whole egg.
         </p>
         <p><span class="red"> When to use Aquafaba:</span> Aquafaba works great to make meringues, marshmallows and
             ice cream!</p>

                    <p class="milk">Today's supermarkets are brimming with non-dairy, plant-based milk alternatives and
                        when it comes to baking, any plant based milk will do! To substitute milk in a recipe, simply
                        swap cow's milk for one of the many non-dairy milks available such as soy milk, almond milk,
                        cashew milk, hemp milk, oat milk or pea milk.

        <h2>Vegan Substitutions for Butter</h2>

                <td>
                    <p class="butter">Butter has specific functions in baking. Some recipes, like shortbread cookies,
                        need butter for flavor, but in many recipes, butter is used to add moisture and texture, and to
                        help create flaky layers. Butter is also a leavening agent, making the final product light and
                        fluffy. </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Vegan butter spread, butter sticks &amp; shortening</h3>
        <p>There are various brands of vegan butter products available in most grocery stores such as Earth Balance,
            Becel and Nutiva. Like with plant-based milk, you can simply swap out the animal-based butter with an equal
            amount of vegan butter.</p>
        <h3>Coconut oil</h3>
        <p>If you want to replace butter with a healthier alternative, then coconut oil is a good substitution.
            Coconut oil is an ideal baking substitute because of its resistance to high temperature. It can be
            substituted in a 1:1 ratio for unsalted butter in any baking recipe.</p>
